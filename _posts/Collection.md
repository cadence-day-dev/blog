We often hear about long-term action, and it feels like the right thing to do. The people talking about it are generally smart, and it's doubtful they are wrong. So it makes total sense to think long term, to plan, and to act deliberately and consistently across long stretches of time, ideally decades.

The truth is, one doesn't always know what to do and how to do it, especially in the early twenties when ideally one should start collecting time fragments and assembling them into threads. I remember being very unclear about how to make the right choices of what to study and generally what to do in life. The choices seemed heavy, associated with the rest of my life, though I don't know exactly why I felt so burdened by thoughts about the future.

If I were to do it over again, I would just do stuff that interests me, try things and observe where I felt the pull, this feeling that guides us when we cannot stop what we are doing because there is a strong attraction towards it.

Now in my 40s I simply act and take notice, register the thoughts and feelings, and it becomes clear what I want to do after a period of action and observation. Once I commit to continuous action, I need a system that inspires me to keep going even when I don't want to, because consistent action is the key.

At some point, the record of all that has been done serves as strong motivation to keep doing it. As long as the important activities are visited with weekly consistency in a predefined amount, at least 5-hour block the transformation influenced by the activity is inevitable, and that is all we can hope for.
